### School District Analysis
## Project overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the data of an entire School District, such as funding and student grades,this analysis was conduced twice due to potential academic dishonesty among a group of students. The implications of omitting the potentially dishonest data are also discussed.
## Resources :
Resources: All data used in this analysis is found inside of the Resources folder.

Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook
## Results
Due to potential academic dishonesty by the ninth grade students of Thomas High School, this analysis was conducted twice. The first trial of this analysis included the full set of student data. In the second trial of this analysis, the ninth grade students of Thomas High School had their scores omitted from the calculations. The entire ninth grade class of Thomas High School have had their scores replaced with NaN. 
t is found that Average Scores and Passing Percentages do not increase as spending per student increases. In fact, the top performing school in the entire school district (Cabera High School) received $68 less per student than the lowest performing school (Johnson High School). This implies that there are more relevant factors than funding that decide average student scores.


The top 5 performing schools were charter schools
When comparing price per student and the overall passing rate the schools that spent under $584 per student had the highest overall passing rate at %90.4
When comparing the schools size and the overall passing rate the schools that had under 1000 students had the highest overall passing rate at %90
